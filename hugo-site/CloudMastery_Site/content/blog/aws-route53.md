# Mastering AWS Route 53 ðŸš€

## Introduction
Route 53 is AWSâ€™s scalable DNS service. In this post, we'll explore how it works, routing policies, and best practices.

## Key Concepts
- Hosted Zones
- Record Types (A, CNAME, ALIAS, etc.)
- Traffic Routing Policies

## Hands-on Example (Terraform)
```hcl
resource "aws_route53_record" "example" {
  zone_id = "Z123456ABCDEF"
  name    = "blog.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 300
  records = ["192.0.2.1"]
}
